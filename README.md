### Introduction
This is general repository of ideas curated by me. It can contain some high level content on things that keep me interested around technology or sometimes it could just go very simple. Mentioned are few of the key writings under this notebook

#### Blockchain Notes
- [ERC-4626](https://github.com/sksmlabs/Notebook/blob/main/ERC-4626.md): ERC-4626 is an extension of the ERC-20 standard that defines a common interface for yield-bearing vaults. Users deposit an asset (e.g., USDC) and receive ERC-20 shares that represent their position.
- [EIP-4844](https://github.com/sksmlabs/Notebook/blob/main/EIP-4844.md): 
- YieldTokens: These notes explores three candidate models—Two-Token Systems, Rebasing Tokens, and ERC-4626 Vaults—each approaching the trade-offs of stability, composability, and yield attribution in unique ways.

#### From Work
- [Macha Federated Network](https://github.com/sksmlabs/Notebook/blob/main/Macha.md): Macha is building a Federated Network for Social Layers with a mission to bring decentralized social content from blockchains and P2P ecosystem together, into a single discovery and distribution layer of new internet. Access the notes on architecture of underlying protocol.

#### Engineering
- [Rust Notes](https://github.com/sksmlabs/Notebook/blob/main/Rust.md): Surface level intro into Rust programming primitives
